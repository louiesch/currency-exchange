## Description

_Application was created for the week 6 independent project at Epicodus, for practice using APIs._
* _A user should be able to enter an amount (in U.S. dollars) and then specify another currency. The user should then see the total amount they entered in converted currency. In the example above, a user might enter 10 dollars and then see that amount in South Korean won._
* _Users should be able to convert U.S. currency into at least 5 other types of currency._
* _If the API call results in an error (any message not a 200 OK), the application should return a notification to the user that states what the error is._
* _If the query response doesn't include that particular currency, the application should return a notification that states the currency in question doesn't exist._
